# Magento2 Helm Chart

Easily deploy Magento2 in Kubernetes including MySQL, Elasticsearch, Redis, RabbitMQ and Varnish.
The project includes best-of-breed charts from Bitnami, Elasticsearch and others to give maximum flexibility for deploying and
configuring the services.

The chart has been battle tested in Magento2 OpenSource and Adobe Commerce production environments. The bundled `values.yaml` provides basic settings, which should be adjusted before deployment.

## Magento2 base image
The chart references [PHOENIX MEDIA's](https://www.phoenix-media.eu) Magento2 Docker image. It consists of an
[Alpine nginx+PHP8.1 base image](https://github.com/PHOENIX-MEDIA/docker-nginx-php), [Magento OpenSource 2.4.4 source code](https://github.com/magento/magento2)
and a few Composer packages to add [build+deploy scripts](https://github.com/PHOENIX-MEDIA/magento2-cloud-build). The image is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/phoenixmedia/magento2)
and the source code including Github Action is available in the [magento2-build repository](https://github.com/PHOENIX-MEDIA/magento2-build).

For more information checkout the article [Running Magento2 in Kubernetes â€”
Part 2: Building the Docker Image](https://medium.com/@bjoern.kraus/running-magento2-in-kubernetes-part-2-building-the-docker-image-8516c0ed7d48).

## Magento ECE-Tools
> ECE-Tools is a set of scripts and tools designed to manage and deploy Cloud projects.

Using [ECE-Tools](https://github.com/magento/ece-tools/) for building and deploying the Docker image reduces the amount
of custom scripts and also gives great flexibility to adjust process as needed.
It is recommended to get familiar with its [build and deploy mechanisms](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/project/magento-env-yaml.html).

It is required to review and adjust the [Magento Cloud environment variables](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/env/variables-cloud.html)
for the `magento` and `cronjob` deployment in the `values.yaml:
- MAGENTO_CLOUD_ROUTES
- MAGENTO_CLOUD_RELATIONSHIPS
- MAGENTO_CLOUD_VARIABLES

Their values are simply base64 encoded JSON objects. To decode them either run `echo "<value>" | base64 -d` or use an
[online decoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) (beware when using sensitive data).

> **_Note:_** It is best practice to maintain sensitive values in a [Kubernetes Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) instead of keeping them in the `values.yaml`.

## Ingress

Before enabling the ingress make sure to configure `host.name` and the TLS certificate properly. When having
[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) installed set `ingress.certManager: true` to automatically generate a
certificate for the application.

If you prefer to skip Varnish for certain routes simply configure addtional paths:

```
    paths:
    - path: "/"
      serviceName: varnish
      servicePort: 80
    - path: "/pub/media"
      serviceName: magento
      servicePort: 80
```

In case you want to protect the Magento backend by IP or BasicAuth we recommend to duplicate the `templates/ingress.yaml`
(e.g. to your Helm project root) and configure a second Ingress with proper annotations.

## Persistence

For the media and var folder Magento usually requires an NFS share. Depending on the Kubernetes environment files shares
are available by referencing the correct storageClass.

In the `values.yaml` the `persistence` section and adjust it:

```
persistence:
  enabled: true
  name: magento-data
  #existingClaim:
  accessMode: ReadWriteMany
  size: 10Gi
  storageClassName: "files"
```

Existing [PVCs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) can be also referenced
by using `existingClaim`.


## SMTP server
supervisord starts a simple Postfix MTA included in the [Alpine base image](https://github.com/PHOENIX-MEDIA/docker-nginx-php).
However, you should configure a mail relay which accepts mails for your Magento instance and is eligible to send emails for
the configured store email addresses.

Make sure to configure it for the `magento` and `cronjob` deployment:

```
    env:
    - name: RELAYHOST
      value: my.relayhost.com
    - name: SMTP_USE_TLS
      value: "true"
```


## Sample data
For fresh installations it is possible to install Magento's sample data. This requires [Magento Marketplace](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html)
authentication keys to be configured. They can be set in the environment variables of the cronjob deployment:

```
  env:
    - name: ADD_SAMPLE_DATA
      value: "true"
    - name: COMPOSER_AUTH
      value: |-
        {
          "http-basic": {
            "repo.magento.com": {
              "username": "<public key>",
              "password": "<private key>"
            }
          }
        }

```

## Xdebug
Debugging in a remote environment can help to bring down resolution time for complex issues. Since Xdebug has to
establish a TCP connection to the IDE, the network setup can become complex.

While this Helm chart won't solve the complexity of setting up a VPN and maybe [DBGp proxy](https://xdebug.org/docs/dbgpProxy)
it deploys an additional container which has Xdebug enabled. In order to route traffic to this Xdebug-enabled Magento container
you have to adjust the Varnish VCL prepared in the `values.yaml`:

```
      # whitelist your developer IPs
      acl xdebug-users {
          "192.168.0.0/24";
      }

      # uncommend these lines
      # use xdebug backend
      #    if (req.http.cookie ~ "XDEBUG_SESSION=" && std.ip(req.http.X-Real-IP, "0.0.0.0") ~ xdebug-users) {
      #        set req.backend_hint = magento_director.backend("xdebug");
      #        return (pass);
      #    }
```

For any request from the whitelisted networks which has the XDEBUG_SESSION request cookie (we use [Xdebug Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-chrome-extension/oiofkammbajfehgpleginfomeppgnglk))
the request will be sent to the `xdebug` pod instead of the normal `magento` pods.

In addition the settings for the `xdebug` workload have to be adjusted in the `values.yaml`:

```
xdebug:
  enabled: true
  reuseMagentoEnvs: true
  env:
    - name: XDEBUG_INSTALL
      value: "true"
    - name: XDEBUG_REMOTE_HOST
      value: "dbgp-proxy"
```

> **_Caution:_** Running Xdebug in a public environment can be a security issue. Enable this functionality at your own risk.

## Helm deployment
The chart requires [Helm 3.x](https://helm.sh/) and has been tested with 3.9.0.
Make sure to adjust the `values.yaml` before deployment.

The Helm command is straight forward:

`helm upgrade -i --create-namespace -n my-namespace magento .`

Deploying the whole Magento2 stack is complex operation and not unlikely when trying it the first time. We prefer to use
optional `--wait --timeout 15m` parameters in a deployment pipeline to see if the deployment was actually successful.

To deploy Magento to different environments (develop, staging, production) it is recommended to create a `values_*.yaml`
for each environment and tune the resource limits and configuration values of the services.

## Docker Desktop Example
The file `values_docker.yaml` will override values inside `values.yaml`. It contains all of the necessary values that would need to change to run the Helm chart in the [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) K8S environment.
The following steps will give a guide on how to achieve that:

### Prerequisites
- Install *Docker Desktop >= 4.10* locally (Tested with 4.10.1) and enable Kubernetes in the settings to start the cluster.
It is also recommended to increase the available resources of Docker Desktop to 4 CPU cores and 8 GB of RAM to ensure a smooth operation. 
Alternatively you may install *kubectl* separately, however that may be a more error-prone approach.
- Clone this repository locally on your computer.

### Step 1
Verify the kubectl context as shown [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/#use-the-kubectl-command) or alternatively generate a `kube-config` file which will be used for the Helm deployment. Make sure to generate it in the same folder as the git repo. Quickest way to do so is:

```
kubectl config view --raw > <name-of-your-file>
```

### Step 2
Set up an environment for Helm. It is recomended to use a Docker container to avoid dependency issues:

```
docker run -ti --entrypoint= -v $(pwd):/apps alpine/helm:latest sh
```

When using the native Helm installation bear in mind that the Helm version needs to >= 3.9

### Step 3
Pull the chart dependencies and deploy the Helm chart.

```
helm dependency update #pulls all the other charts that our chart uses
helm upgrade -i --kubeconfig <name-of-your-kubeconfig-flie> -f values_docker.yaml --create-namespace -n <your-namespace> magento .
```

### Step 3.5
Check the progress of the Helm deployment in Kubernetes (*not in your docker container*)

```
kubectl get pods -n <your-namespace> -w
```

### Step 4
After the deployment has fully finished an Ingress-NGINX instance is needed to access Magento store through the browser. Since Docker Desktop ships without a Kubernetes Ingress, [see here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/), use the following Helm command to deploy it:

```
helm upgrade --kubeconfig kube-config --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace
```

The command above deploys an Ingress-NGINX pod that has access to the `/etc/hosts` file. Make sure to add a mapping for the predefined  Magento domain, *magento.local*, in this file to ensure the domain points to the local K8S cluster. Ingress will then forward the traffic to the Magento instance.

```
echo "127.0.0.1 magento.local" >> /etc/hosts
```

### Step 5
Navigate to `http://magento.local` in your browser and play around with your local Magento installation!

#### Disclaimer
This guide and the `values_docker.yaml` file are configured for the *magento.local* domain. If you wish to use a different domain,
then you would need to update a few lines on the said file: 

```
magento:
  env:
    - name: MAGENTO_CLOUD_ROUTES
      value: <base64-encoded-string-containing-your-domain>

cronjob:
  env:
    - name: MAGENTO_CLOUD_ROUTES
      value: <base64-encoded-string-containing-your-domain>

ingress:
  hosts:
    - name: <your-domain>
```

## GKE Example
The file `values_gke.yaml` will override values inside `values.yaml`. It contains all of the necessary values that would need to change to run the Helm chart in a GKE K8S environment.
The following steps will give a guide on how to achieve that:

### Prerequisites
- Create a google account (if you do not already have one) and start a free trial on [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine). It is recommended to use the inbuilt terminal, since it will include all the necessary dependencies like Helm, kubectl, gcloud and so on. 
- Clone this repository in the machine you decided to use

### Step 1
Create a new project and make sure it is connected to your billing account [as seen here](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)

### Step 2
Switch the gcloud context to the newly created project

```
gcloud config set project <project-id>
```

### Step 3
Enable all necessary api services

```
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable file.googleapis.com
```

### Step 4
Create new cluster

```
gcloud container clusters create <cluster-name> --zone=asia-east1-a --addons=HttpLoadBalancing,GcePersistentDiskCsiDriver,GcpFilestoreCsiDriver --image-type=UBUNTU_CONTAINERD --machine-type=e2-standard-2
```

### Step 5
Create static IP for ingress (Optional, since ingress IP will not change unless you redeploy it) and update the *values_gke.yaml* file

```
gcloud compute addresses create <adress-name> --global
```

### Step 6
*OPTIONAl* Update the *managed-cert.yaml* file with your available domain in order to generate a ssl certificate for https and deploy it with kubectl

```
kubectl apply -f managed-cert.yaml -n gkedemo

```

### Step 7
Pull the chart dependencies and deploy the Helm chart.

```
helm dependency update #pulls all the other charts that our chart uses
helm upgrade -i -f values_gke.yaml --create-namespace -n <your-namespace> magento .
```

### Step 8
Wait until all the deployments are done and make sure that there is a dns ressource resolving the domain name to the ingress ip. Afterwards navigate to `http://<your-domain>` and enjoy

#### Disclaimer
This guide and the `values_gke.yaml` file are configured for the *magento.phoenix-media.rocks* domain. You will need to update a few lines on the said file: 

```
magento:
  env:
    - name: MAGENTO_CLOUD_ROUTES
      value: <base64-encoded-string-containing-your-domain>

cronjob:
  env:
    - name: MAGENTO_CLOUD_ROUTES
      value: <base64-encoded-string-containing-your-domain>

ingress:
  hosts:
    - name: <your-domain>
```
